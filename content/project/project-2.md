## Summary

BC Safety Authority’s accident prevention strategy follows a risk
based platform, called “bow tie” for ongoing management and prevention
of major incidents. The bow tie method draws on the direct experience
of safety management team and the data collected from various safety
oversight programs in order to identify hazards and to properly
incorporate critical controls into management systems. In addition, it
raises awareness and improves understanding and risk knowledge of the
potential major incidents and the reliance on critical controls that
prevent those accidents from occurring. Opportunities exist for
greater connectivity among various databases to maximize the risk
knowledge, especially the pre incident data based on inspections and
post incident data.
