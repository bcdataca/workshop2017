### A short course in linear algebra and software tools

There will be an optional short course before the main workshop, covering some
linear algebra theory combined with an introduction to open source software
tools for mathematical computing. This short course will run August 9-11 and
will involve lectures on the theory, combined with computational
examples. Notes will be posted.

#### Day 1: Wednesday August 9

##### Linear algebra:

Linear systems, condition number, sparse direct techniques,
conjugate gradient (Krylov subspace) methods and preconditioning.

##### Software:

[Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) shell, version control with
[`git`](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com),
[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks, and programming in [Python](https://www.python.org/).

#### Day 2: Thursday August 10

##### Linear algebra:

Least squares (regression), vector Newton’s method, nonlinear optimization
(Newton’s method, gradient descent) 

##### Software:

Scientific computing in Python: [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/), [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)


#### Day 3, Friday August 11

##### Linear Algebra:

Change of basis (FFT), eigen-analysis, singular value decomposition (principle
component analysis)

##### Software:

Numerical computing with NumPy and basic machine learning with [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
