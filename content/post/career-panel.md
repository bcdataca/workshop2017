## Career panel at Mobify

{{< youtube ctOFh51xzmM >}} 

## Summary

On the evening of August 16th, BC Data Science workshop participants
gathered at [Mobify headquarters](https://goo.gl/maps/aVGFmNH1huB2)
for a career panel and social event. The panel discussed non-academic
career options for mathematicians; how mathematicians should prepare
for industry jobs and job interviews; and what differences to expect
in industry. More broadly, the panelists discussed career success,
personal values, and strategies for achieving career-oriented goals.

The panel included recent graduates in mathematics/statistics now
working in industry, as well as a senior manager at Amazon who
interfaces with &mdash; and hires &mdash; mathematicians and computer
scientists. The Q&amp;A session was followed by a lively social with
complementary food and beverage.

## Career panel takeaways

A collection of resources mentioned by the panelists that could be
useful to those contemplating industry.

* [Data for Good](https://www.meetup.com/DataforGood-Vancouver/about/)
  (Vancouver Chapter)
* [The Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/) was recommended by
  Zak as a good book for business-related material important for
  consultancy and startups.
* Brian Wetton offered resources to IAM students for new indepedent
  group projects.
