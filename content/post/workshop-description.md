## Overview

This workshop will host 50 graduate students in mathematics and interested
industry members for a two week foray into foundational and crucial elements of
the rapidly expanding field of data science.

The first week of the workshop will cover
[introductory data science](../first-week-lectures) material through morning
lectures and afternoon hands-on [mini-projects](../mini-projects). The second week will cover
[advanced topics in data science](../advanced-topics) through morning lectures
hosted by a diverse range of professors; and 5 [week-long projects](../../#projects) in teams of
10, each led by an industry mentor.

Prior to the workshop will be a prequel workshop covering requisite aspects of
elementary mathematics and programming that will be assumed as background. For
more information on the pre-workshop, see [this post](../prequel-description). 

Then, the workshop will kick-off on Monday morning, 8:30 AM, with a catered
breakfast at the main location,
[UBC Robson Square](https://goo.gl/maps/13QmETxJY5C2).
