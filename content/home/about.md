# Goal

Targeted at graduate students in the Institute of Applied Mathematics at UBC
and students at SFU with similar interests, the 2017 IAM Workshop in Data
Science has two goals: to bring together top researchers, industry
professionals and BC Math students to tackle interesting research and industry
problems; and to develop data science literacy in students with strong
mathematical skills who may have little or no previous experience in the realm
of "data science".

This workshop will give students experience with data science tools &mdash;
such as working with large data sets, statistical inference, and machine
learning &mdash; that will be helpful in their research, as well as in their
career options after graduation. For more information on workshop content,
visit the [posts](#posts) section or see below for additional information.
