# Summary

The two-week workshop will include both theoretical and practical
components, featuring lectures on the theory of algorithms used in data science
and the freeware implementation of these methods. In the first week, data sets
from industry and government will be introduced by guest speakers and used as
examples data sets for mini-projects. Each data set will lead to a capstone
project in the second week.

Computational work will be done with Jupyter notebooks using
[bcdata.syzygy.ca](https://bcdata.syzygy.ca). Participants will have
the opportunity to work with big data, and learn subsequent analysis
motifs using machine learning, data clustering, parameter fitting, and
other techniques.

There will be a short course in linear algebra and software tools prior to the
workshop to cover background material in scientific computing, linear algebra,
statistical methods and optimization. For more information, see the
[pre-workshop description](./post/prequel-description).

See below for a [detailed schedule](#schedule). Lecture notes and workshop materials can be found on the [associated GitHub repository](https://github.com/bcdataca/workshop-content).
